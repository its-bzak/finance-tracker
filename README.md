# Finance Tracker #

### What is it? ###
A full-stack personal finance tracking app built with modern web + mobile technologies.

### Why? ###
As a college student who was routinely struggled with budgeting, I've come to understand how much stress your financial situation can put you under, 
really effecting the quality of not only your work, but your life as a whole.  

My goal with this application is to create a clean, fast, privacy-focused finance tracker that works across web, iOS, and Android.
